# js-astar

Demo - https://cdn.mjp.co/demos/js/astar/

A simple Javascript OO A* path finder class.

Well commented code. Perfect for learning but not optimised for performance.

## Map Maker

To convert two colour PNGs into a Javascript array for use with the A* class, use the `generate-map.php` script.

```bash
php generate-map.php mymap
```

This will read mymap.png and generate a mymap.js file.
